Modfwango
=========
***

Modfwango is a modular server/client socket framework written in PHP.  This framework has been refined over the past two years for personal use, and I have just recently decided to make it open to the public.  This IRC bot framework has been used by me almost every day for the past couple of years.  It is based off of Modfwango-Client at https://github.com/ClayFreeman/Modfwango-Client which is specialized for playing the client role in network communication.  It is stable, clean, modular, and object oriented.


Install
=======
***

This bot was tested under Ubuntu Linux and Mac OS X.  Windows compatibility is unknown, and probably unstable.  To use this framework, make sure that you have the latest version of PHP 5 CLI installed on your machine.  Configuration for this bot is inside the configuration directory `conf/`.  After you are done configuring the bot, just run the main file with `php main.php` and the bot will start.  You can put this into a screen just by doing `screen php main.php`.


Development

Refer to the [wiki](https://github.com/ClayFreeman/Modfwango/wiki) for more information.
